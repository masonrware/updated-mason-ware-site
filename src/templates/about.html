    <p style='padding-top: 10%'>Hi everyone, my name is Mason. I am currently an undergraduate student at Brandeis Univeristy studying Computer Science
    and Applied Mathematics. I became interested in Computer Science because of Game Development, and while I am no longer pursuing such a career, I am still
    an avid gamer. Here is a video made by my favorite youtuber (videogamedunkey) about a game made by my favorite game developer (toby fox): </p><br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QtplRk6BdyA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
    <br><p>I grew up in Los Angeles, California as the elder child in a single-parent-household. My fascination with computers started at a very young age.
        I think it really started with Legos, but the first time I picked up a soldering iron in my middle school STEM class, I knew I had found something
        I connected with. My official relationship with Computer Science started when I took a CS class in high school. Learning Java and doing problem sets
        started me down a path that I am still walking. Since my admittance to Brandeis, I have stratified my CS interests, branching into fields like systems
        programming and learning complimentary languages like Rust and C++. 
    </p>
    <br><p>Currently, I am working to become a black-belt in Python development and bolster my skills in relevant CS areas. Reading programming books, taking
        CS courses, and gaining internship experience are all ways in which I am striving to do so. My last oppurtunity, at Cleeng, was informative and worthwhile
        as it strengthened my web-development skills greatly. My next oppurtunity I hope will be in the fields of networking and cloud programming. Overall, getting
        'cracked' at  python, rust, and C++ is my most realistic next step and I hope to make it the first of many in a comprehensive and successful career.
